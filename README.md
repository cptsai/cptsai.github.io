# Hello !
This is my very first time building a personal blog and the first time building on GitHub.
Nice to meet you here!

For one who wants to build a personal blog like me.
I recommend you go through the reference. Basically, I found (ref. 1) first and then just follow the instrument, haha.

Here are some keypoints:
0. Know the basic of GiHub from (ref. 2)
1. Create the repository as <username>.github.io (ref.3)
2. Althrough the Hexo is mentioned in (ref. 3) and the Jekyll is recommended by GitHub (ref. 4), the file structure of Hugo is used in the (ref. 5), see (ref. 6) and (ref. 7-9) for detail.
3. So I choose Hugo too XD
4. Install Git, Go and Hugo
5. Build a new site
6. Initial Git
7. Clone the theme you like / or subnodule the theme
